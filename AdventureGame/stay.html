    Tato decided to stay and stand his ground, hoping that his boss and coworkers don't realize that he's a potato. Unfortunately for him, humans are smart. The boss grabbed Tato and threw him in the shredder and later, the oil batch. He was finally turned into some nice McDonald's Gilroy Garlic Fries and was consumed by the king himself, Joey from Joey's World Tour. NOICE!
